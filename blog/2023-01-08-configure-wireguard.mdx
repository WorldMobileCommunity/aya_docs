**WireGuard** is a VPN solution that has gained popularity due to its simplicity and performance.
It uses public and private keys to establish an encrypted connection, or "tunnel,"
between two devices called "peers." This allows you to communicate between two devices securely
over untrusted networks.

In this post, we will go through the basics of configuring WireGuard on a Linux server and connecting
Peers. You will also learn how to route Internet traffic through the WireGuard Server in a gateway configuration
and how to use the WireGuard VPN for an encrypted peer-to-peer tunnel.

**At the end of this walkthrough you will have:**

- A Linux server running a configured instance of WireGuard

- A Peer connected to your Linux server using the WireGuard VPN

**Things this article doesn't cover (maybe in a pt.2?):**

- How to configure a VPN mesh using WireGuard

- How to configure firewalls external to the Linux server

- Steps you can take to properly secure your keys

- How to tunnel **ALL** of a peers traffic over the vpn

## Before we begin

---

There are a few things that you will need to have in place in order to follow along with this tutorial:

- **A Linux server:** You will need a Linux server to install and configure WireGuard on. In this tutorial, we will be using Ubuntu 20.04 LTS, but the instructions should also be similar for other distributions.

- **A Public IP address:** In order to access your WireGuard Server from the internet, you will need a public IP address.

- **Basic knowledge of networking concepts:** In order to understand and follow along with the instructions in this tutorial, while not required, it would be helpful if you have a basic understanding of networking concepts such as IP addresses, ports, and protocols.

- **Sudo privileges:** In order to install and configure WireGuard, you will need to have sudo privileges on your Linux server.

- **A Peers device:** In order to test your WireGuard connection, you will need a device such as a desktop or another server.

## Installing WireGuard and Generating Keys

---

Update package list:

```bash
sudo apt update
```

Install WireGuard on your server.

```bash
sudo apt install wireguard
```

Create the private key for WireGuard using the following command:

```bash
wg genkey | sudo tee /etc/wireguard/private.key
```

Then change permissions for the key file:

```bash
sudo chmod go= /etc/wireguard/private.key
```

You should receive a single line of base64 encoded output; this is the private key.
A copy of the output is also stored in the /etc/wireguard/private.key file.

Create the public key, which is derived from the private key, to distribute to Peer machines.
Use the following command to create the public key file:

```bash
sudo cat /etc/wireguard/private.key | wg pubkey | sudo tee /etc/wireguard/public.key
```

You should receive a single line of base64 encoded output; this is the public key.

You have now installed WireGuard on the server and generated both the public and private key files.

## WireGuard Server Configuration

---

Now that you have the key files, you will want to create the config file `wg0.conf`.
You will then edit with a CLI-based text editor called nano.

```bash
sudo nano /etc/wireguard/wg0.conf
```

Add the following lines to the file. Substitute your private key, the IP address from the subnet you want to use, and the port.
If you are not sure what to select you can use the information from the example. Just be sure to update your private key.

```bash
[Interface]
PrivateKey = <Peer's Private Key Goes Here>
Address = 10.11.12.1/24
ListenPort = 51820
SaveConfig = true
```

Save and close the config file by pressing `CTRL+X` then `y` and then `ENTER`.

## Configure UFW (Uncomplicated Firewall)

---

Yes, that is what it is called.

:::info
If you changed the port or would like to restrict peers that can attempt to connect via IP address,
modify the below commands accordingly.
:::
Allow traffic to the WireGuard UDP port itself:

```bash
sudo ufw allow 51820
```

Restart the firewall

```bash
sudo ufw disable && sudo ufw enable
```

Verify the firewall rules:

```bash
sudo ufw status
```

The WireGuard Server is now configured to handle the VPN traffic correctly.

## Starting the WireGuard Server

Setup a `systemd` service so that WireGuard will start at boot:

```bash
sudo systemctl enable wg-quick@wg0.service
```

:::info
Entering the tunnel name `wg0` allows you to map to the `/etc/wireguard/wg0.conf` config file.
This syntax allows you to create multiple tunnels all with different configurations.
:::
Veryify that the service is running:

```
sudo systemctl status wg-quick@wg0.service
```

---

## Configuring WireGuard Peer

---

Configuring a WireGuard peer is similar to setting up the WireGuard Server. Once the Peer software is installed,
generate a public/private key, populate a configuration file, and start the tunnel using wg-quick.

Update package list:

```bash
sudo apt update
```

Install WireGuard on your server.

```bash
sudo apt install wireguard
```

**Create the private key** for WireGuard using the following command:

```bash
wg genkey | sudo tee /etc/wireguard/private.key
```

Then change permissions for the key file:

```bash
sudo chmod go= /etc/wireguard/private.key
```

You should receive a single line of base64 encoded output; this is the private key.
A copy of the output is also stored in the /etc/wireguard/private.key file.

:::info
Do not disclose your private key to anyone that you do not want to have access to your server.
:::

Create the public key, to distribute to the WireGuard Server.

Use the following command to create the public key file:

```bash
sudo cat /etc/wireguard/private.key | wg pubkey | sudo tee /etc/wireguard/public.key
```

## WireGuard Peer's Configuration File

---

Now you can create a configuration file for the peer that contains all the information to establish a connection to the WireGuard Server.

What you need for the configuration file:

- The `private key` that you generated on the `peer`.

- The IPv4 address range that you defined on the WireGuard Server

- The `public key` from the `WireGuard Server`.

- The `public IP address` and port number of the `WireGuard Server`.

Create `/etc/wireguard/wg0.conf` file on the WireGuard Peer:

```bash
sudo nano /etc/wireguard/wg0.conf
```

Add the following lines to the file:

```bash
[Interface]
PrivateKey = <The Peer's Private Key Goes Here>
Address = 10.11.12.2/24

[Peer]
PublicKey = <WireGuard Server's Public Key Goes Here>
AllowedIPs = 10.11.12.0/24
Endpoint = <WireGuard Servers Public IP Address Goes Here>:51820
```

:::info
If you changed any of the defaults, edit the text to reflect the appropriate information.
:::

## Adding the Peer's Public Key to the WireGuard Server

---

Ensure that you have a copy of the base64 encoded public key for the WireGuard Peer by running:

```bash
sudo cat /etc/wireguard/public.key
```

Now log back into the `WireGuard Server` and run the following command:

```
sudo wg set wg0 peer <Peers public key goes here> allowed-ips 10.11.12.2
```

Very the peer line shows in the WireGuard peers public key and address:

```bash
sudo wg
```

## Connecting the WireGuard Peer to the Tunnel

If you only want the VPN on for specific use cases use the wg-quick command to establish the connection manually.
If you want to start the VPN at boot, follow the same configuration steps performed during the [Starting the WireGuard Server](/blog/wireguard-walkthrough#starting-the-wireguard-server) section.

Run the following command to set this up:

```bash
sudo wg-quick up wg0
```

You can check the status of the tunnel on the peer using the wg command:

```bash
sudo wg
```

Very you can ping the ipv address for the WireGuard Servers VPN interface:

```bash
Ping 10.11.12.1
```

Once you are ready to disconnect from the VPN on the peer, use the wg-quick command:

```bash
sudo wg-quick down wg0
```

If you didn't choose to auto start the VPN, you can run the `wg-quick up wg0` & `wg-quick down wg0` activate and deactivate the VPN now.

## Conclusion

You now have an established VPN using WireGuard between two endpoints that provides you with a secure connection to manage your server or access information and resources.
