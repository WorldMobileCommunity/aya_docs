# Getting Started

## What is Aya?

Aya is the code name for the World Mobile sidechain. EarthNodes will eventually be hosting many different value-added services apart from the blockchain. So how do we refer specifically to the sidechain? We call it Aya!

The name Aya comes from one of the [Adinkra symbols](https://symbolsage.com/aya-adinkra-symbol-meaning/), which means fern. This symbol represents resourcefulness and endurance.

Aya is built using the Cosmos SDK, interfacing with Cardano via smart contracts.

## Aya testnet

Aya entered the first testnet phase on December 29th, 2022.

A testnet is a type of blockchain built to test features and solve bugs before going into real-world production. Therefore, you should expect Aya to evolve rapidly as new features are added, and bugs are resolved.

As you may already know, a testnet is a progressive and iterative deployment. The goal is to test everything step by step, from the joining process to block production to delegation.
